# Attributes

**Attributes** â€“ characteristics of a certain [product](https://treopim.com/help/products) that distinguish it from other products, e.g. size, color, functionality, components and features that affect the product's attractiveness or acceptance in the market. 

An attribute can be assigned to only one [attribute group](https://treopim.com/help/attribute-groups). Value of a certain attribute set for a certain product is called *product attribute value*. It it possible to define the same product attribute different values for each channel. 

Attributes can be assigned to several [product families](https://treopim.com/help/product-families), so it the product for that product family is created, the selected attribute will be added to the product attributes automatically.

Attributes can be activated or deactivated. Deactivated attributes cannot be used in the system, e.g. no values can be set to them or transferred via any channel. All the values of the deactivated attributes are hidden and will be shown again after the attribute is activated again.

## Attribute Fields

The attribute entity comes with the following preconfigured fields; mandatory are marked with *:

| **Field Name**           | **Description**                   |
