# Associated Products

**Associated Products** – two products, which are related within a certain association. So there is Main Product and Related Product. Related products are not automatically cross-linked, so if the product A (main product) is related to product B (associated product), it does not mean that product B is automatically related to product A. 

The option to create associated products targets on increasing sales and help in promotion and marketing of new products, but has a slightly different configuration process.

TreoPIM comes with the following predefined associations:

- **Up-sell products** are the products with higher price and quality, which could be more popular with shoppers and more profitable for the sellers. Up-sell products are generally packed with special features or other competitive advantages to encourage customers to change their mind and buy these ones. 

- **Cross-sell products** are complementary products, which could be bought in addition to the main one. Good examples are cases or a smartphone covers that can be offered to a shopper, who is buying a smartphone. These are the products the customer would probably also look for.

- **Related products** are usually products of the same category and type as the selected product or service. These are competitive alternatives to provide the customer with a wide number of options in addition to the main product. Sometimes related products are useful for promotion of less popular products or for attracting customers' attention to possible alternatives.
