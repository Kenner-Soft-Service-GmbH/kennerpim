# Associations

**Association** – the type of the relationship between products, where one in some way is dependent on the other one(s), or can influence the other one(s) in accordance with different marketing strategies (e.g cross-sell, up-sell, etc.). Each product can associate different products and can be associated from different products.

Associations can be activated and deactivated. Deactivated associations cannot be used in the system, i.e. all records of the associated products will not be transferred via any channel.

## Association Fields

The association entity comes with the following preconfigured fields; mandatory are marked with *:

| **Field Name**           | **Description**                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Active                   | Activity state of the record      |
| Name (multi-lang) *      | Association name, e.g. сross-sell |
| Backward association     | Backward association name         |
| Description (multi-lang) | The aim of this association usage |

> If you want to make changes to the association entity (e.g. add new fields, or modify association views), please contact your administrator.

Either way will open the editing pop-up window, where you can make any changes needed. 

### Removing the Association

To remove the association record, use the `Remove` option from the actions drop-down menu or from the single record actions drop-down list.

By default, it is not possible to remove the association, if there is any product associated with it.

### Duplicating the Association

Use the `Duplicate` option from the actions drop-down menu to go to the association creation page and get all the values of the last chosen association record copied in the empty fields of the new association record to be created.

## Working with Associated Products

[Associated products](https://treopim.com/help/associated-products) are related to the associations and are shown as a small list view on each product page.

By default, the following fields are displayed in the small detail view for associated products:
 - Related product image
 - Related product
 - Association

TreoPIM also offers you the ability to add associations to all the products (or as many as needed) simultaneously via the mass actions menu.
