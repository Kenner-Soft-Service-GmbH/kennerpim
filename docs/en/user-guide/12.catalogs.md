# CATALOGS

A catalog is a container for your goods arranged by certain criteria, i.e. it is a set of data at a given time compiled to be transferred via certain channels. Catalog's content may be modified whenever needed via the TreoPIM functionality.

Catalogs, as well as channels, form the basis of the multichannel publication of your products data. They allow you to manage your range of goods and carry out your multichannel strategy in the most flexible manner. 

With the help of catalogs you can create as many versions of your goods as you need, preserving the ability to modify your data within your company exclusively and not worrying about possible changes made by your goods suppliers during the data transfer.

The catalog structure can be different for each user, based on their needs. For instance, catalogs can be used to segment your range of goods for further export of the product data to certain channels, as well as to store historical information about your goods (e.g. "Winter jackets 2019" and "Winter jackets 2020").

## Creating and Editing a Catalog

To create a catalog, go to the catalogs page and click the "Create Catalog" button:

![Catalog-creating](../../_assets\catalogs\catalog-create_en.png)

Here enter the desired name for your catalog being created and assign it to the corresponding category. The catalog description is an optional field and can be left empty.

**TIP:** *Give your catalog a clear unique name that will help you quickly identify its destination and target audience.*

Click the "Save" button to create your catalog. You will be taken to the Edit view of the newly created catalog:

![Catalog-editing](../../_assets\catalogs\catalog-edit_en.png)

Here you can activate or deactivate your catalog by setting or removing the "Active" checkbox correspondingly, edit its name, category, description, if any.

You can also remove or duplicate the catalog by choosing the corresponding option from the "Edit" dropdown list:

### Catalog Channels

On the Edit view page of the catalog you can assign a channel (or several channels) to your catalog using the Create button:

![Adding-channels](../../_assets\catalogs\catalog-add-channel_en.png)

On the "Create Channel" page give a name to the channel being created; its code will be generated automatically in the corresponding field. Also add the currency (or several currencies) to be used for this channel. Adding locales and description is optional, so these fields may be left empty. Click the "Save" button to create the channel â€“ it will appear in the "Channels" section on the Edit view of the catalog:
