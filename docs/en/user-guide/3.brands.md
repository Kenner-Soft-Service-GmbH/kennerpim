# Brands

**Brand** â€“ a name, term, design, symbol, or other feature that distinguishes the product from its rivals in the eyes of the customer. Brands are used in business, marketing and advertising to increase sales. 

By default, only one brand can be assigned to the product. Brand is optional for the product. It is technically possible to have different brands with same name, because of different IDs that would be assigned to them.

Brands can be activated or deactivated. Deactivated brands cannot be used in the system and are not transferred via any channel.

| **Field Name**           | **Description**                            |
