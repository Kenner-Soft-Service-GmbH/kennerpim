# User Interface (UI)

The user interface (UI) includes all visible elements users see and interact with while using TreoPIM. This chapter describes all the main elements of user interface, which are the same for all entities in the system, as well as how to perform common tasks or operations in the system.

The following elements make up the TreoPIM user interface:

- **Navigation Menu** – to navigate through available entities.
- **Taskbar** – to help the user interact with the TreoPIM system in a more efficient way; additional information or actions are displayed here. 
- **Search and Filtering Panel** – to search and filter within one entity or its related entities.

Within the TreoPIM system your information may be presented in various ways:

- **List View** – to view the lists of entity records.
- **Detail View** – to view the entity record details.
- **Create View** – to create a new entity record in the main window.
- **Edit View** – to edit the entity record.
- **Quick Detail View (Popup)** – to view the record details in the popup window.
- **Quick Edit View (Popup)** – to edit the record detail in the popup window.
- **Quick Create View** – to create a new entity record in the popup window.

## Sign in (Login)

To sign in to TreoPIM, enter your username and password and click on "Login". You will be automatically remembered, until you sign out. 

### Password Recovery

To recover your password, please click on the text link "Forgot Password?" and enter your username and email address.

## Navigation Menu

The navigation menu in the default TreoPIM theme is the menu placed on the left side of your user interface. It allows you to open list views for all entities in the system.

The navigation menu can be configured by your Administrator according to your needs.

Each user can customize his/her own navigation menu in the "User Interface" section of the user "Preferences" page:

![Navigation Menu Cfg](../../_assets/user-interface/navigation-user-cfg.jpg)

Here select the "Custom Tab List" option and add the desired tabs using the "Add" button.

## Taskbar

Taskbar is a top panel of the TreoPIM user interface:

  ![Taskbar](../../_assets/user-interface/taskbar.jpg) 

A taskbar consists of a global search field and some functional icons that help you work and collaborate within the TreoPIM system.

### Global Search

You can search all the records existing in the TreoPIM system using the global search functionality. Use the search form on the taskbar for it:

![Global Search](../../_assets/user-interface/global-search.jpg) 

### Desktop Notifications

TreoPIM uses two types of notifications: email notifications and system notifications (desktop notifications). Generally, email and desktop notifications are configured globally, for all users.

User can receive notifications in case when:
- a record is assigned to him;
- changes are made to the record he is following.
![Desktop Notifications](../../_assets/user-interface/desktop-notifications.jpg)
<!-- I think we need a different screen here - w/ 2 variants of notifications -->
### Progress Manager

Progress Manager is opened in the popup window for each operation executed displaying its status and a shortcut to the operation details. 

In the Progress Manager you will see the most recent TreoPIM operations, which were executed in the background mode or run automatically via scheduled jobs, i.e latest imports and exports.
![Progress Manager](../../_assets/user-interface/progress-manager.jpg)

### Quick Create

To create new records from anywhere, click the Quick Create icon in the upper right corner of the taskbar on any TreoPIM page and choose the entity for the record to be created.

The quick create view will be opened:

![Quick Create](../../_assets/user-interface/quick-create.jpg) 

To change or extend the entity list available in the quick create menu, please contact your administrator.

## Search and Filtering Panel

Searching and filtering allow you to quickly focus on the records you want to see. The description of various searching and filtering options available for you in the TreoPIM system is given below. 

Search and filtering sections are automatically available on each entity list view:

![Search and filtering](../../_assets/user-interface/search-filter.jpg) 
*Search and filter on the products list view page*

Searching works on the current entity records, while filtering works also on the related records, which are configured by the administrator.

To perform a search operation, enter your search query into the corresponding field and hit the "Enter" key on your keyboard or click the ![search-button](../../_assets/user-interface/search-button.jpg) button.

To filter your entity records, open the filter drop-down list and set the desired checkbox(es). To clear all filters, click the "Reset" button, located to the right of the search field:
![Search and Filtering Panel](../../_assets/user-interface/search-and-filtering-panel.jpg) 

Use the Global Search if you wish to search globally across all the entities in the system.
  
By default, search is performed through all the records, which attributes start with the search string. If you want to search for the records, which attributes contain the search string, please use the "%" symbol before your search string (without space); the use of "%" at the end of the search string is not necessary.

The fields available for searching can be configured by developers in the metadata of the appropriate entity.

You can have one or more filters based on a certain field for all field types besides the following:
  - Boolean;
  - Array;
  - Multi-Enum;
  - Enum;
  - Related entities.

A field of any of these types can be used as a filter only once, because there is no need for it.

### Logical Operators

The system behavior is different for the OR and AND logical operators:
- Currently the use of these operators in the search field is not possible.
- Operator AND is automatically applied between filters set up for different fields, e.g. "name" and "brand".
- Operator OR is automatically applied between filters set up for the same field, e.g. both filters set up for "name".

Logical operator NOR is directly not available, but can be set by defining specific filter criteria for almost each field type.

### Available Filtering Criteria

Depending of the field type, you can apply the following filtering criteria:

| Field Type                 | Filtering Criteria   | Input Value                      |
| ––––––––––––––––––––– | ––––––––––– | ––––––––––––––––––––––––––– |

### Automatic Search Mask Recognition *(in development)*

TreoPIM has automatic search mask recognition. This can be considered as a quick search function, i.e. when you start typing, TreoPIM automatically determines the search mask type of your search string. Automatic search mask recognition is available for the following fields: Text, Number, Date, and Time.
<!--I added "Time" - correct? -->  

Depending on the search mask type, the system searches through all entity fields of the appropriate field type. A pop-up with auto-suggestions appears with the information about field name and amount of search results for this field, i.e. "Address: 3 results", and the text link(s) to show the results.

If nothing is chosen from the auto-suggesting pop-up, click the magnifier icon to perform normal search (only through the fields listed in the metadata for this entity).

After clicking on the search results, the appropriate filter will be set automatically and the search field will be left empty.

| Search Mask Type    | Field Types to Be Searched          | Applied Filter Criteria |
| –––––––––––- | –––––––––––––––––––––– | –––––––––––- |
| Теxt, e.g. "treo 123"  | Address, Number, Varchar, Text, URL, Wysiwyg | Starts with       |
| %Text, e.g. "%treo 123" | Address, Number, Varchar, Text, URL, Wysiwyg | Consists        |
| Numbers, e.g. "123"   | Address, Number, Varchar, Text, URL, Wysiwyg | Starts with       |
| Numbers, e.g. "123"   | Auto-increment, Currency, Integer, Float   | Is           |
| Date, e.g. "12.12.2018" | Date, DateTime                | On           |

### Predefined Search Filters

Predefined search filters are available in the drop-down menu on the left of the search field on any entity list view page:

![Search filters list](../../_assets/user-interface/search-filters-list.jpg) 

To extend the list, please save your custom search filters for the desired entities or contact your developer.

### Custom Search Filters

To save a custom search filter, please, contact the administrator.
<!-- Since user has no access to the "Administration" page, I suggest moving the description with the screenshot to the admin's guide, when it's created, and leave here just a sentence about contacting the admin 
To save a custom search filter, you need to do the following:

- On the "Administration > Layout Manager" page, set all the search filters you need for the desired entities and apply them.
- Click on the drop-down for predefined filters on the left of the search field.
- Click on the option Search Filter and then in the popup define the name for it and save it.
![Custom Filters](../../_assets/user-interface/custom-filters.jpg)

## Breadcrumb Navigation

TreoPIM comes with breadcrumb navigation on each page in the system. Breadcrumb navigation is a form of a path-style clickable navigation, which links the user back to the prior website page in the overall online route. It reveals the path the user took to arrive to the given page. The ">" symbol separates out the hierarchical search order from beginning to end and may look something like:
`Home Page > Section Page > Subsection Page`
